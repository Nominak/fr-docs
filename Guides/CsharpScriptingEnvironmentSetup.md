# How to setup development environment for C# scripts

## Prerequisites

1. FiveReborn installed client. Get it [here](https://forum.fivem.net/t/fivereborn-release/89).
3. FiveReborn installed server. Get it [here](https://forum.fivem.net/t/fivereborn-release/89) (same as above).
2. Visual Studio 2015 Community. Its free. Get it [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/ru/downloads/).

We will assume that you client installed here `C:\FiveReborn\client` and server installed here `C:\FiveReborn\server`.

## Creating a solution

1. Create it from template: "Visual C#" -> "Class library".
2. You want it to be created inside `resources` folder of the server installation. Thats to simplify development.
3. If you dont like the default name of class VS created for you feel free to rename it as you want. I prefer name the class after solution name.
4.
